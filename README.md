# Wumpus World DQL Agent
## Project Overview
This project represents the final assignment for the Intelligent Systems course, implementing a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) agent to navigate the classic Wumpus World environment. The agent learns to find gold while avoiding dangers like pits and the Wumpus through reinforcement learning.

## Environment Description
The Wumpus World is represented as a 10x10 grid where:
- üèÅ Starting position is fixed at (3,3)
- üèÜ Gold is the target reward
- üòà Wumpus and pits are deadly obstacles
- üåÄ Breezes indicate nearby pits
- ü¶® Stenches indicate nearby Wumpus
- ‚ú® Flashes indicate nearby gold

## Features
- Deep Q-Network (DQN) implementation with 6 neural network layers
- Experience replay memory for improved learning
- Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy
- Automatic environment sensing and reward calculation
- Performance visualization with matplotlib
- GPU support when available

## Technical Details
- Built using PyTorch for deep learning
- Uses numpy for matrix operations
- Implements replay memory for experience replay
- Features customizable hyperparameters
- Includes comprehensive state and action space definitions

## Requirements
```
torch
numpy
matplotlib
tensorflow
```

## Usage
Run the main script to start training:
```python
python wumpus_dql.py
```
The program will display:
- Real-time training progress
- Success rate statistics
- Average steps per episode
- Death count
- Visualization plots

# Training Visualization
The code generates three plots showing the agent's learning progress:

![Success Rate per Episode](img/wumpus2.png)
*Graph showing the success rate of outcomes per episode*

![Steps per Runtime](img/wumpus3.png)
*Graph showing the number of steps per runtime*

![Deaths per Runtime](img/wumpus4.png)
*Graph showing the number of deaths per runtime*
